    "Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of relevant features (variables) from the original set of features to be used in a machine learning model. In the context of anomaly detection, selecting the right features is crucial because irrelevant or redundant features can introduce noise and make the anomaly detection algorithm less effective. Good feature selection can improve the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection models by focusing on the most informative attributes."

Points that are not part of any cluster are considered noise."

If it's too large, it might merge different clusters or consider distant points as part of the same cluster.
