    "A decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant feature. Each split is chosen to maximize the separation of classes (in classification tasks) or reduce the variance (in regression tasks). This process creates a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a class label or a numeric value (in regression)."

    "Feature Selection: For each feature, the algorithm calculates the impurity of potential splits. It chooses the feature and split point that result in the greatest reduction in impurity. This step effectively determines the best question to ask for splitting the data.\n",

For example, if you're predicting whether an email is spam or not, the tree might ask questions about the presence of certain keywords, sender's information, etc. At each split, the algorithm chooses the feature that best separates the two classes. Once the tree is built, new data points traverse the tree, and their predicted class is determined based on the majority class in the leaf node they reach."
