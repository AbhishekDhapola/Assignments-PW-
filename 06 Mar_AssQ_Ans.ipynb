    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It provides methods and techniques for summarizing and making sense of complex data sets, helping to extract meaningful insights and patterns from raw information. Statistics is widely used in various fields such as science, economics, social sciences, business, and more, to make informed decisions, draw conclusions, and formulate predictions based on data."

    "Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: These are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They include measures like mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and graphical representations such as histograms and scatter plots. Descriptive statistics provide a way to get a quick overview of the data without making any generalizations beyond the data itself. For example, in a survey of students' ages, calculating the mean age would provide an average age of the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: These are used to draw conclusions and make predictions about a population based on a sample from that population. Inferential statistics involve techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. They allow researchers to make inferences about a larger group based on the data collected from a smaller subset. For instance, in a medical study testing a new drug, inferential statistics can help determine if the observed effects are likely due to the drug itself and not just random chance."

    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between values are not uniform or well-defined.

Ordinal data can be summarized using median and percentiles.\n",

Examples include temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit. You can perform addition and subtraction operations on interval data, but not multiplication or division.\n",
