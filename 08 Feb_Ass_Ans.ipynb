    "Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the process of hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It is a technique that allows us to focus on the essential aspects of an object while ignoring the irrelevant details.\n",

However, while driving a car, we only need to focus on the essential features such as the accelerator, brake, and steering wheel. We do not need to worry about the details of how the engine works or how the wheels rotate. This is an example of abstraction in OOP."

    "Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It is a way of thinking about objects in terms of their essential characteristics, rather than their implementation details.\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world. It is a way of protecting the internal state of an object and preventing it from being modified by external entities.\n",

An example of encapsulation is the use of access modifiers in Java or C#, which allows you to control the visibility of a class's members."
