R-squared indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. Therefore, R-squared is suitable for comparing the performance of SVM regression models using different kernels in terms of explaining variance."
