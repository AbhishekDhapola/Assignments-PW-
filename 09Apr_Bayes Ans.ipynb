Here are three common types of Naive Bayes classifiers and their typical use cases:\n",

    "Gaussian Naive Bayes: This classifier assumes that the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It's suitable for continuous numerical data where the distribution of each feature is approximately Gaussian.\n",
