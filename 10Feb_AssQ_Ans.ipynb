    "'r': Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading.\n",
    "'w': Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated. If it doesn't exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "'a': Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but data will be appended to the end of the file rather than overwriting it.\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. This is used in combination with the other modes to indicate that the file should be treated as a binary file.\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation mode. Opens the file for writing, but only if it does not already exist. If the file exists, an error will be raised."
