    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, it can be caught and handled by the program to prevent it from crashing. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as when attempting to perform an invalid operation, accessing a non-existent file, dividing by zero, or encountering other runtime issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are categorized into different types based on the specific error that occurred. Some common built-in exception types in Python include TypeError, ValueError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are a different type of issue. They occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not follow the correct syntax rules of the language. Syntax errors prevent the code from being parsed and executed by the interpreter. These errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summarized difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Exceptions occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "2)They disrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "3)They are caused by runtime issues, such as invalid operations, division by zero, etc.\n",
    "4)Exceptions can be caught and handled using try and except blocks.\n",
    "5)Examples of exception types include TypeError, ValueError, etc.\n",
    "6)Exceptions can be raised explicitly using the raise statement.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur before the program starts running, during the parsing phase.\n",
    "1)They prevent the program from being executed.\n",
    "2)They are caused by incorrect syntax or grammar in the code.\n",
    "3)Syntax errors cannot be caught using try and except blocks, as they prevent the code from being executed at all.\n",
    "4)Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, unmatched parentheses, etc.\n",
    "5)Syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the code according to Python's syntax rules."
