    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong learner (a more accurate and powerful model). The key idea behind boosting is to iteratively train a series of weak learners, each focusing on the mistakes made by its predecessors. By combining the predictions of these weak learners, boosting aims to create a final model with improved accuracy and generalization."
