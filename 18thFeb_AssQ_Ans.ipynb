The weather app doesn't generate its own weather data; instead, it makes requests to a remote weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve the latest weather information for a specific location."

    "Interoperability: APIs enable different software systems to work together seamlessly, even if they are developed using different technologies.\n",
    "Efficiency: Developers can focus on specific tasks without needing to understand the entire system.\n",
    "Innovation: APIs encourage third-party developers to create new applications and services that can enhance the functionality of existing systems.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency: If an API changes or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt the functionality of dependent applications.\n",
    "Security Concerns: Poorly designed APIs can expose sensitive data or provide an entry point for attacks if not properly secured.\n",
    "Versioning and Compatibility: Changes to an API can break compatibility with existing applications, requiring careful version management.\n",

It is based on a set of constraints that emphasize a stateless client-server interaction, scalability, and a uniform interface. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, which are represented as URLs.\n",

    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It relies on XML for message formatting and can use various transport protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, and more. SOAP APIs define a strict structure for messages and require more overhead compared to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP messages are verbose and complex due to their XML structure, which can lead to slower performance and larger data payloads.\n",
    "Overhead: The additional XML processing and strict message structure can introduce significant overhead in terms of processing time and network bandwidth.\n",
    "Limited Compatibility: SOAP APIs might face compatibility issues between different programming languages and platforms due to the rigid nature of the protocol.\n",
