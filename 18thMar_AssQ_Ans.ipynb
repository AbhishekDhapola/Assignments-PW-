    "The Filter method in feature selection is a technique used to select relevant features from a dataset before building a predictive model. It involves evaluating the intrinsic characteristics of each feature without involving a specific machine learning algorithm. The filter method ranks features based on certain statistical measures or criteria, and then selects a subset of the top-ranked features for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method works by computing some statistic or score for each feature, which measures its correlation with the target variable or its variance within the dataset. Common filter methods include Pearson correlation coefficient for continuous variables, ANOVA for categorical variables, and mutual information for general cases. Features are then ranked based on these scores, and a predetermined number or percentage of top-ranked features are selected for modeling."

    "The Wrapper method is another approach for feature selection, but it differs from the Filter method in that it involves using an actual machine learning algorithm to evaluate the performance of different subsets of features. Instead of relying solely on statistical measures, the Wrapper method creates multiple models with different subsets of features and evaluates their performance using cross-validation or a similar technique. It aims to find the best subset of features that yields the highest model performance.\n",

    "The Wrapper method is more computationally expensive than the Filter method as it involves training and evaluating multiple models, but it can potentially lead to better feature subsets tailored to the specific model being used."
