    "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. In logistic regression, two common types of regularization are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge). These methods add a penalty based on the absolute values of the coefficients (L1) or the squared values of the coefficients (L2). This discourages the model from relying too heavily on any one feature and encourages it to consider all features."
