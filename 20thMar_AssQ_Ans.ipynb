    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another. In the context of data science, it often refers to converting categorical data (data that represents labels or categories) into a numerical format that can be easily understood by machine learning algorithms. This is important because many machine learning algorithms work with numerical data and might not directly handle categorical data. Data encoding helps in preparing the data for analysis, modeling, and prediction tasks."

    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, involves assigning a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable.

    "Real-world scenario example: Let's say you're analyzing a survey about car preferences. One of the columns is \"Car Brand\" with categories \"Toyota,\" \"Ford,\" and \"Honda.\" You can use nominal encoding to convert these categories into numerical labels: \"Toyota\" - 1, \"Ford\" - 2, \"Honda\" - 3."

For example, if you have a \"Education Level\" column with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD,\" there's a clear ordinal relationship, and nominal encoding might be suitable. Additionally, if you have a categorical variable with many levels (e.g., postal codes), using one-hot encoding could lead to a high-dimensional dataset.\n",
