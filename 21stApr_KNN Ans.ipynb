    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance lies in how they measure the distance between data points in the feature space. Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points, while Manhattan distance (also known as L1 distance or taxicab distance) is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.\n",
