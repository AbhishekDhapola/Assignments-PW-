    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical values for machine learning algorithms. The main difference lies in the nature of the categorical variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: In label encoding, each unique category is assigned a unique integer label. This is suitable for nominal variables, where the order doesn't matter. For example, if you have a \"Color\" feature with categories \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" they might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2.\n",
