    "K-means Clustering: Divides data into a specified number of clusters (k) based on minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and their cluster centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by either iteratively merging small clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or dividing large clusters into smaller ones (divisive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN): Identifies clusters as dense regions separated by less dense areas. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It can model clusters with different shapes and sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Shift Clustering: Focuses on finding regions of high data density by iteratively shifting points towards the mode of the local density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Clustering: Utilizes the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix to partition data into clusters, often used when clusters have complex shapes or are not well-separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy Clustering: Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, rather than assigning them to a single cluster."
