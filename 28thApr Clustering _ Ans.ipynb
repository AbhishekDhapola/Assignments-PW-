It starts with every data point as its own cluster and then iteratively merges or agglomerates clusters based on some similarity measure until all data points belong to a single cluster or a specified number of clusters is reached. The result is a dendrogram, a tree-like structure that shows the sequence of cluster mergers.\n",
