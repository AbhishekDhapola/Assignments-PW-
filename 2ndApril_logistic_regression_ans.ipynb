It works by exhaustively trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within predefined ranges and using cross-validation to evaluate each combination's performance. This helps in selecting the hyperparameters that result in the best model performance while preventing overfitting."

    "Randomized Search CV: It randomly samples hyperparameters from predefined distributions. This method is more efficient in terms of computational resources, as it doesn't explore all possible combinations but has a good chance of finding good hyperparameters. It's often preferred when computational resources are limited.\n",
