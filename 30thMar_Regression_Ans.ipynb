    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. It's used for predictive modeling when you have a large number of features and want to prevent overfitting, multicollinearity, and perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between Elastic Net and other regression techniques lies in its regularization terms. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals, while Ridge regression adds the L2 penalty term (squared magnitude of coefficients), and Lasso regression adds the L1 penalty term (absolute magnitude of coefficients). Elastic Net combines both penalties, allowing it to handle cases where there are correlated predictors (Lasso may arbitrarily select one) and to shrink coefficients even to zero (like Lasso), which Ridge may not do."
