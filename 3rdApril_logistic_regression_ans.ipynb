    "Logistic regression is a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two possible classes. However, it can also be extended to handle multiclass classification problems, where there are more than two classes to predict. There are two main approaches to using logistic regression for multiclass classification: the \"One-vs-Rest\" (OvR) approach and the \"Softmax\" (or \"Multinomial\") approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-vs-Rest (OvR) Approach:\n",
    "In the OvR approach, you create a separate binary logistic regression classifier for each class in the dataset. For each classifier, one class is treated as the positive class while the rest of the classes are treated as the negative class. In essence, you're breaking down the multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems.\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each class, you train a binary logistic regression model using the data from that class as the positive samples and the data from all other classes as the negative samples.\n",
    "During prediction, you run all the binary classifiers on the input data, and the class associated with the classifier that produces the highest probability is predicted as the final class.\n",
    "This approach is simple and effective, but it might struggle if the classes are highly imbalanced or if there's a lot of overlap between the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax (Multinomial) Approach:\n",
    "The softmax approach, also known as multinomial logistic regression, directly extends logistic regression to multiclass problems. It calculates the probability distribution over all possible classes using the softmax function.\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating multiple binary classifiers, you have a single classifier with multiple output nodes, one for each class.\n",
    "The output of each node is transformed using the softmax function, which squashes the outputs into a probability distribution that sums up to 1.\n",
